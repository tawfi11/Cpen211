Partner 1:
made lab7_top_tb.v to test lab7_top
altered CPU to output correct signals
altered datapath to receive correct signals
created tri-state buffer module
connected RAM to CPU, with appropriate connectors as seen in stage 1
created new FSM states and outputs for STR and LDR functions
defined outputs for new FSM states
created chipsets seen in stage 3
made files compatible with autograder


Partner 2:
Worked on new states in FSM, connections for cpu (within) and lab7_top, test files test4,test1
